# THIRTY-EIGHTY
This just searches a few retailers to see if a certain highly-coveted GPU is available for purchase. It expects them to be out of stock, so a "failure" means you should go try to buy one. It won't try to buy one automatically, because that seems like a shitty thing to do.

# Usage
```
./bin/thirty-eighty
```

If you want to change search terms, update `config/config.yml`.

# Known Issues
The occasional false positive on newegg.
